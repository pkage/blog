# Turning Vim into a Writing Productivity Powerhouse

Vim has many benefits. It's powerful, it's easily extensible, it runs entirely
in your terminal so you look like a 1337 hacker every time you use it. One
downside, however, is that out-of-the-box it isn't a fantastic environment to
write long-form text in. Vim is very busy, it doesn't wrap lines by default,
and the commands for showing word count and other useful metrics aren't
obvious. I'm currently writing my thesis in LaTeX, and I wanted a better way to
write in Vim.

## Simple configuration

First offâ€”addressing the line width issue. Vim by default doesn't wrap lines,
and you have to turn that on. I like to use:

```vim
set fo+=t
set tw=79
```

The `tw` option (`textwidth`) sets the text width to 79 characters, and to use
Vim's `fo` options (`formatoptions`) to do so. We also add the `t` flag to `fo`, ensuring that words are auto-wrapped to the test-width.

See more format options at the [`fo-table` documentation](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/change.html#fo-table).

## Keybinds

There are only two keybinds that matter now: `gw` and `g^g`. `gw` + a motion
allows for automatically wrapping text. I use `gwip` frequently, which
autowraps the inner paragraph your cursor is on. `g^g` prints the current word
count as long as some other information down at the statusline.

## Plugins

The next problem to address is the visual clutter. I find it much easier to
write when there are no distracitnos on the screen. The two plugins I rely on
most here are Junegunn Choi's absolutely fabulous
[Goyo](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim) and
[Limelight](https://github.com/junegunn/limelight.vim). Goyo clears out all
visual clutter (gutters, statusline, etc.) and centers your window, while
Limelight takes it a step further by only highlighting the paragraph you are
working on and dimming the rest.

They can be easily installed with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug 'junegunn/goyo.vim'
Plug 'junegunn/limelight.vim'
```

Even better, you can wire Limelight to activate when Goyo activates, making for
an easier experience:

```vim
autocmd! User GoyoEnter Limelight
autocmd! User GoyoLeave Limelight!
```

Note that depending on your terminal you may need to set the Limelight
concealment color manually:

```vim
let g:limelight_conceal_ctermfg = 'gray'
```

## Custom Config

Remembering all those is a pain! Why not just stick these in your `.vimrc` (or
`init.vim`)?

```vim
" Writing configuration
command WriteMode set tw=79 | set fo+=t | Goyo 85 | echo "Write mode enabled."
command WriteModeDisable set fo-=t | Goyo | echo "Write mode disabled."
let g:limelight_conceal_ctermfg = 'gray'
autocmd! User GoyoEnter Limelight
autocmd! User GoyoLeave Limelight!
```

This lets you enable writing mode with `:WriteMode`, and disable it with
`:WriteModeDisable`. I also like to override `W` to act as `w`, because I
fatfinger `:W` a lot and that would activate writing mode rather than no-op.
That's a very easy one-liner:

```vim
command W w
```

## Command Completion

One last thing: adding command completion for Vim makes for a very ergonomic
experience, especially when writing LaTeX. I like
[coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) which is a very good
[LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) implementation for
Vim8/Neovim. Unlike other completion engines, it is easily installed with:

```vim
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim'
```

Once installed, you should be able to install a server for LaTeX
easily with `:CocInstall coc-texlab`!

## Demo

Putting it all together, you get:

Pretty cool, right?
