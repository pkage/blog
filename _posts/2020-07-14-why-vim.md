# why vim?

I'm a Vim user, which is an increasingly uncommon text editor choiceâ€”especially
in 2020. The question I'm always asked is, "Why don't you just use VS Code or
another more modern editor?"

I guess the answer is just that I like it that way. Of course there are benefits
to those other editors, but Vim is the editor that just works, is extremely fast,
and you can generally count on it being installed already on whatever system you
wander onto.

Modal editing is really nice as well. I don't generally like using the mouse,
and being able to jump around in normal mode and then do my fine-grained editing
in normal mode is excellent.

Plus, I've got it aliased to "v" in my terminal.
